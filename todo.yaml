SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix memory bug (leak probably) with ask_file
    fix file write verify segfault/crash
    fix file write verify overflow with empty file
    fix file write not accepting cancel
    fix read range
    fix multi write scrolling
    fix multi write (timing?) causing unreliable writes
    fix file write freeze
    use 8k buffer in large I/O operations
    put more things in PROGMEM
    update documentation
    fix anything that seems broken:
      test more thoroughly
      find and fix double screen clears
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
      optimize drawing?
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io:
    add FileCtrlSerial
  add EEPROM SDP feature?
  fix page write (low priority):
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
