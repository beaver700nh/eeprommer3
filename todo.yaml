SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix page write:
      find way to optimize it
      remember to check 64-byte limit
    add EEPROM SDP feature?
    fix multi write scrolling
    fix file write vrf bug
    clean up:
      split ask_foo() into ask_screen.?pp files
      reduce duplication in ProgrammerFileCore
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
