SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    make it intelligently decide whether to use serial or sd:
      IN PROGRESS!
      menu?
      alternate intro screen for non-SD
    write multi is bugged?:
      nvm figured it out - page write broken
    check for address rollovers
    triple check all mallocs
    add progress bar on read range
    put labels (addr) on ReadRange
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
    add help screen(s)
  start work on from_serial programmer

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date
