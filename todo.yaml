SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix memory bug (leak?) with ask_file
    fix file write verify segfault/crash
    fix read range
    fix multi write scrolling
    fix `MenuKeyboard`s
    pack structs
    improve "Total" box on Memory
    put more things in PROGMEM
    make stuff allow PROGMEM strings
    fix anything that seems broken:
      test more thoroughly
      find and fix double screen clears
    make Controllers struct so no passing `XXXCtrl&`s everywhere:
      nvm just make them global
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
      optimize drawing?
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io:
    add FileCtrlSerial
  add EEPROM SDP feature?
  fix page write (low priority):
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
