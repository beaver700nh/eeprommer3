SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix file write verify segfault/crash
    CLEANING:
      add overview file to explain relations between files/classes
      turn TftUtil::show_error into Dialog::show_dialog():
        replaces some `tft.drawText()`s
        create TftUtil::DlgErrLevel enum
    fix multi write scrolling
    fix anything that seems broken
    update ProgFileCore to use `fsys`s
    create get_file_to_read_to() or similar
    deal in `FileCtrl`s instead of file paths
    clean up prog_core if possible
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
      optimize drawing?
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io:
    add FileCtrlSerial
  add EEPROM SDP feature?
  fix page write (low priority):
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
