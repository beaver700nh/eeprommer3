SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix multi write scrolling
    clean up:
      ask_foo() work:
        split into ask_screen.?pp files
        make ask_addr() in prog_core.cpp
        fix ask_file() to check fsys
      split some gui stuff into other files
      reduce duplication in ProgrammerFileCore
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
      optimize drawing?
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io:
    add FileCtrlSerial
  add EEPROM SDP feature?
  fix page write (low priority):
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
