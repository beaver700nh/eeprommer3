SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    make it intelligently decide whether to use serial or sd:
      IN PROGRESS! - finish
      menu? - continue
      alternate intro screen for non-SD - done
    write multi is bugged?:
      nvm figured it out - page write broken:
        fix that ASAP
    check for address rollovers
    triple check all mallocs
    add progress bar on read range
    put labels (addr) on ReadRange
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
    add help screen(s)
  start work on serial file io

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
