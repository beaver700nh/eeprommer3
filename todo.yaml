SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  start work on serial file io:
    add FileCtrlSerial
  quality-of-life:
    crashes e.g. file verify
    find and fix double screen clears
  fix page write (low priority):
    quick mode in eeprom.cpp - remove delay between bytes
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
