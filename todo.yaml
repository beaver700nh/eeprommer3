SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    fix page write
    add EEPROM SDP feature?
    fix multi write scrolling
    fix file write vrf bug
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
    add FileCtrl, auto-selects between file systems
    put labels (addr) on ReadRange
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
