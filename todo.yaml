SOFTWARE:
  add more pictures/icons for window
  scrap most of it?:
    a lot is already implemented in FIRMWARE so unnecessary to rewrite here
    should make much more simple SOFTWARE that only does what FIRMWARE can't
    start reimplementation

FIRMWARE:
  last changes before v0.0.1-rc1:
    finish FileCtrl stuff
    fix multi write scrolling
    check ask_fsys returned cancel
    clean up:
      put reused lambdas into variables in Util
      split ask_foo() into ask_screen.?pp files:
        make ask_addr() in prog_core.cpp
      reduce duplication in ProgrammerFileCore
    make progress bars look better:
      unsatisfying off-by-one stuff
    switch repr mode on ReadRange
  start work on serial file io
  add EEPROM SDP feature?
  fix page write (low priority):
    find way to optimize it
    remember to check 64-byte limit

HARDWARE:
  check if up to date

OTHER:
  update stuff like docs
